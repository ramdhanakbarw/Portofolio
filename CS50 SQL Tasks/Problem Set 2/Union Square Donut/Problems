Your task at hand is to create a SQLite database for Union Square Donuts from scratch. The implementation detail should minimally ensure that your database meets the team’s requirements and that it can represent the sample data.

Schema Requirements

Ingredients (The team would love to keep track of the price we pay per unit of ingredient (whether it’s pounds, grams, etc.))
Donuts (The name of the donut, whether the donut is gluten-free, the price per donut, and the ingredients for each of the donuts)
Orders (An order number, all the donuts in the order, and the customer who placed the order. (The team assume only one customer places any given order.))
Customers (A customer’s first and last name, a history of their orders)

Sample Data

Your database should be able to represent…
Cocoa, for which Union Square Donuts pays $5.00 for one pound.
Sugar, for which Union Square Donuts pays $2.00 for one pound.
Union Square Donuts’ “Belgian Dark Chocolate” donut, which is not gluten-free, costs $4.00, and includes the following ingredients:

Union Square Donuts’ “Back-To-School Sprinkles” donut, which is not gluten-free, costs $4.00, and includes the following ingredients:
