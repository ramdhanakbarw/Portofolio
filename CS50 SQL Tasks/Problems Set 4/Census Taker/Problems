You are a census taker working for the Nepali government. As you crest one final hill, your breath catches at the sight of a Himalayan sunrise, casting a glow on the village you’ve journeyed so far to reach. Your guide, a local, halts abruptly. Underneath the steady rustle of your census papers, you feel an itch of curiosity. After all, it’s not every day your job takes you to a village like this one.

In the census table, you’ll find the following columns:
-id, which uniquely identifies each census record
-district, which is the name of the census record’s district
-locality, which is the name of the census record’s locality within the district
-families, which is the number of families associated with the census record
-households, which is the total number of households associated with the census record (multiple families may live in the same household)
-population, which is the population associated with the census record
-male, which is the number of people associated with the census record who have identified as male
-female, which is the number of people associated with the census record who have identified as female
